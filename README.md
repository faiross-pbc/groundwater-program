# FairOSS Groundwater Program
The goal of the program is to provide and implement a framework to allow open source participants the opportunity to receive equity for their contributions.

This repo is identifying the outline and basic structure that allows the Groundwater Program to unfold.  By designing the architecture of the program we can identify the projects and priorities to making it a reality.  With your help!
